# A variation from a reasonable Emacs config

This is a fork of Steve Purcell's Reasonable Emacs config to which I
added more org-mode and python stuff, as well as emms and other
things of doubtful usefulness.

The original file can be found as README.old in case you want the installation instructions,
but this is probably not wise.
